pschtt (/pʃɪt/)
======

Summary
------
pschtt (projects, schedule, calendar, holidays, time tracking) is an open-source web application based on node.js.

pschtt allows users to register the time spent on projects and activities, submit and visualize their holidays, import tasks from their calendar, etc.

How-to make something work
------
First, cd to the repository and do:

    npm install

so that node will automatically install the required node modules (dependencies are described in the package.json file).

Then, simply do:

    node server.js

Voilà! You now have a running express server on port 3000.
